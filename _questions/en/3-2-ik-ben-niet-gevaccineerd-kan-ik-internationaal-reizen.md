Yes, you can if you carry a negative test result with you. Within Europe, a testing result is accepted as valid proof (the Digital Coronavirus Certificate). Before leaving, please read through the terms on  {{ site.data.translations.wijsoprijs-link[page.lang] }}. This way you’re well-prepared for your trip.
