title: I’m from another European country. Can I use my certificate to visit an event or location in the Netherlands?

Yes, you can. The domestic rules are the same for European citizens as they are for Dutch people. When your certificate meets the Dutch rules, as a European you’re allowed to visit events in the Netherlands.
