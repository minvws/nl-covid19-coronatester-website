## About

This repository contains the source files of the official website for CoronaCheck and CoronaCheck Scanner and is available at [CoronaCheck.nl](https://CoronaCheck.nl)

## Status

Please join the Slack channel and check out the kanban board for the latest status. 

## Design principles

* Design principle 1: Clarity and usability over eye candy
* Design principle 2: Test the results on the target group, guerrilla testing in the supermarket, etc. 
* Design principle 3: Mobile first
* Design principle 4: Usable for anyone (so: simply formulated in B1 language level, tested on users, etc.)
* Design principle 5: Confirm to the design principles of  [Gebruiker Centraal](https://www.gebruikercentraal.nl/).
* Design principle 6: The website 'feels' just like the app itself (tone of voice ("je", not "u"), graphics, interaction patterns, UX design, use, etc.)

## Development & Contribution process 

Note: rather than rely on a third party CDN or dependencies that are not part of this repository; all assets and dependencies are part of this build. Please go to [the vendor licenses directory](./vendor-licenses) for the vendor licenses.

The development team works directly from this open-source repository. If you plan to propose changes, we recommend opening an issue beforehand where we can discuss your planned changes. This increases the chance that weâ€™re able to use your contribution (or it avoids doing work if there are reasons why we wouldn't be able to use it).
