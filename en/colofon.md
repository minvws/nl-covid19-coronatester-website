The CoronaCheck and CoronaCheck Scanner apps have been developed by the Ministry of Public Health, Welfare and Sport in collaboration with the RIVM and the national GGD institutions. The app could not have been realised without the help of dozens of experts, experience experts and a large civilian open-source community, who has monitored the process and tested the app as it was being developed. 

## Source code

The app's source code and its backend systems are all publicly available. You
can find all code on [GitHub](https://github.com/minvws). This way, the precise
way the app works is verifiable and controllable by many people, who can also
help discover any potential vulnerabilities.
