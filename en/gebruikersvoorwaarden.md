## About the terms of use

In these terms of use you will read how CoronaCheck Scanner works, what you’re able to do with it, and what your rights and responsibilities are. Please read the terms of use carefully before you accept them. By accepting these terms, you declare to VWS that you’ve completely read, understood, and accepted these terms. If you do not agree with these terms, you will not be able to install CoronaCheck Scanner.

## How does the CoronaCheck Scanner app work?

### Download and installation

To check the validity of a coronavirus pass or DCC, you need CoronaCheck Scanner. You can download CoronaCheck Scanner for free from the Apple App Store (for iOS) and the Google Play Store (for Android) and install it on your smartphone or tablet. Please only download CoronaCheck Scanner from the App Store or Google Play Store and watch out for fake apps. CoronaCheck Scanner is only supported on iOS version 11 and up and Android version 6 and up.

After CoronaCheck Scanner has been downloaded and these terms are accepted, CoronaCheck Scanner can be used. Before you can use the app, you must read these terms of use and accept them. You can find these terms of use on [CoronaCheck website](/en/gebruikersvoorwaarden.html).

### Scanning a corona admission ticket

When a person presents a coronavirus pass or DCC to the controller, the validity of the coronavirus pass or DCC can be verified by using the CoronaCheck Scanner app. A person can display a digital or physical coronavirus pass or DCC. To validate a coronavirus pass or DCC, no internet connection is required. When the coronavirus pass is scanned using CoronaCheck Scanner, the moving visual animation next to the QR code scanner serves as a security check. Using this animation, a controller can verify if the QR code in CoronaCheck has not been screenshotted. 

After scanning, a green or red screen will be shown. Green means that the coronavirus pass is valid, red means that it is invalid. A green screen also shows a set of identifying data (first letter of first name, first letter of last name, date of birth and month of birth). The controller should compare the data shown in the CoronaCheck Scanner with the data on the person’s identity card, to check if the coronavirus pass or DCC belongs to the person showing it. If a green screen shows and the data matches, the controller can grant access to the event or location.

It is important to note that CoronaCheck Scanner does not record this set of identifying data, nor is it allowed to record this data or the data on the identity document. When CoronaCheck shows a red screen (no valid coronavirus pass or DCC), it will also include a general description outlining possible causes for this status. 

It’s possible a grey screen is displayed after scanning a QR code. This only happens after scanning a QR code developed to test the functioning of the CoronaCheck Scanner app. A grey screen does not give any information about a person but is simply a reflection of a test code.

### Updates

It’s important to use the latest version of the app. You also need to use the newest operating system from Apple or Android (Google). If you’re not using the latest updates, the app may not work properly.

To prevent abuse and/or malfunctions and/or other issues, please ensure your devices and connections are adequately protected against unauthorised third-party use, malware, Trojans and viruses.

### More information

For more information on the (technical) functioning of the CoronaCheck Scanner app, please refer to the information as published on GitHub. This information is not legally binding and does not guarantee the workings of the CoronaCheck Scanner app.

### Uninstalling the app

If you no longer wish to use the app, you can uninstall the CoronaCheck Scanner app from the smartphone or tablet on which the CoronaCheck Scanner app is installed.

## For whom is the CoronaCheck Scanner app intended?

The app is publicly available in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. A controller can deny access using the CoronaCheck Scanner app if persons are unable to display a coronavirus pass or DCC or when the CoronaCheck Scanner app shows a red screen after scanning a corona admission ticket.

## Why use CoronaCheck Scanner?

The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (hereinafter: “coronavirus”) has tremendous social impact on Dutch society. By containing and controlling coronavirus, society can slowly return to normal and economical damage can be limited as much as possible. The CoronaCheck Scanner app is intended to scan the coronavirus pass or DCC persons show to a controller and ascertain if someone is allowed access to a certain location. It is a legal requirement to use only this app for scanning. By only allowing access to certain locations to people who can prove they have recently tested negative for coronavirus, have been vaccinated or have recovered, further spread of coronavirus can be limited.

## The CoronaCheck Scanner app does not offer protection from coronavirus

Scanning a coronavirus pass or DCC indicates that a person was not infected with coronavirus at the time of testing, recovered from coronavirus or recently tested negative for coronavirus. However, this does not guarantee that this person cannot infect others with coronavirus at the time of scanning the QR code with the CoronaCheck Scanner app.

## Privacy

The use of the CoronaCheck Scanner app does not involve processing of personal data. The CoronaCheck Scanner app requires consent to use the scanner’s phone camera. This consent is required to scan the coronavirus pass or DCC, in the form of a QR code. Without this consent the user can install the app but cannot use the app to scan the coronavirus pass or DCC, in the form of a QR code.

### Purpose limitation

The CoronaCheck Scanner app is used to regulate access to a certain event or location by checking if someone has a coronavirus pass or DCC. This is only possible when a person shows a valid coronavirus pass or DCC. When using the CoronaCheck Scanner app, it is not allowed to capture a coronavirus pass or DCC in any way, including but not limited to taking a screenshot. The CoronaCheck Scanner app may only be used to read a coronavirus pass or DCC. Saving or recording coronavirus passes or DCCs presented to a controller is strictly prohibited.

## Security

When using CoronaCheck Scanner, connections are secured and encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and certificate pinning.
In addition, transport encryption (TLS) is used for all connections in combination with certificates from the Dutch Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Overheid and certificate pinning. The latter means that CoronaCheck Scanner only connects to servers that have certificates issued by the PKI Overheid.

Important configuration files, e.g. in which the functioning of the app can be influenced, are digitally signed. This process also exclusively uses and accepts certificates issues under the supervision of the Dutch government.

## Functioning of the CoronaCheck Scanner app

The CoronaCheck Scanner app has been designed with great care. VWS works hard to make sure the app functions as well as possible and continues to develop and improve. Despite these efforts, VWS cannot guarantee that the CoronaCheck Scanner app functions flawlessly or without interruptions. It could happen that the CoronaCheck Scanner app is unable to read a QR code properly, for example.

By accepting these terms of use, you agree that CoronaCheck may not function flawlessly, may not be available temporarily, partially, permanently or entirely and that notifications are not received or processed by you timely and/or fully.

Do you have a question or complaint about the CoronaCheck Scanner app or do you want to report a malfunction? Please consult the [CoronaCheck website](https://coronacheck.nl/en).  

## Liability

VWS is not liable for any damages suffered through the use of the CoronaCheck Scanner app. VWS does not accept any liability for the consequences of any inaccuracies in the data made available in the app. 

VWS can stop offering the app or change the content at any time (also [see Termination of the CoronaCheck Scanner app](#termination-of-the-coronacheck-scanner-app)).

VWS it not liable for any damage or costs incurred by you or third parties, for whatever reasons, because of the use or inability to use the app.

## Intellectual property rights

You hereby obtain a right to use the CoronaCheck Scanner app. This right of use is non-exclusive, non-transferable, cancellable, non-sublicenseable. The app, all copy and images in the app and the software in the app are property of VWS.

## Change of terms

VWS may change the terms if and when VWS deems necessary. The date and version valid at the time of accepting the terms are listed at the bottom of the terms. If after installation you do not agree with the (change of) terms, you must uninstall the CoronaCheck Scanner app.

## Termination of the CoronaCheck Scanner app

Checking coronavirus passes and DCCs to allow access is a temporary crisis measure. This means what will happen in the future cannot be predicted. For this reason, VWS can decide at any time to terminate use of the CoronaCheck Scanner app. Should this happen, you will be informed via the [CoronaCheck website](https://coronacheck.nl/en).  

## Applicable law and competent court

These terms are subject to Dutch law. Any dispute with VWS in relation to these terms or the use of the CoronaCheck Scanner app will be settled by the court in The Hague.

## Other

If any part of these terms is illegal, not valid or unenforceable, such will not affect the remaining terms. You agree that when VWS does not make use of the rights set out in this condition, this cannot be construed as a waiver of rights.
