## Travelling

You can create your coronavirus pass (EU Digital COVID Certificate, DCC) to travel with CoronaCheck. [Read more about how to create a Digital COVID Certificate](https://coronacheck.nl/en/faq/1-1-hoe-werkt-de-coronacheck-app/). 

Are you going on a trip? Please check {{ site.data.translations.wijsoprijs-link[page.lang] }} to find out which coronavirus pass you need in the country you’re planning to visit.

From July 1st, you can get tested for free when you go travelling. Read more about this on {{ site.data.translations.reizen-en-vakantie-link[page.lang] }}.

If you have any questions, you can turn to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/contact/contacting-the-24-7-bz-contact-centre" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Please reach out to its 24/7 contact centre</a>. They are available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

## Vaccination certificate

Do you want to retrieve vaccination details in the app? [Read here how to retrieve your vaccination details](/en/faq/1-1-hoe-werkt-de-coronacheck-app/).

### Get your complete vaccination
In order to create a domestic QR code, you need to be fully vaccinated. An international QR code can be created after one vaccination. Please be aware: a QR code based on 1 vaccination is not valid in all countries. Make sure to check the travel advice on {{ site.data.translations.wijsoprijs-link[page.lang] }}.

### Can’t create a certificate and were you vaccinated in the Netherlands?
Are you, for example, experiencing one of the following problems:

- Is your name or date of birth incorrect?
- Do you see both vaccinations on one day?
- Can't you retrieve your vaccination details, even though your last vaccination was over 3 days ago?

Then your vaccination details may not have been registered properly. Please contact your vaccinator (GGD via {{ site.data.translations.phone-ggd[page.lang] }}, hospital or general practitioner or another healthcare provider). 

Please note: are your details properly registered with the GGD, but are you still unable to retrieve your details? We are aware of this issue. We’re working hard to find out where the cause is in order to resolve the issue. If you are going on a trip or want to visit an event within a few days, the advice is to schedule a free test appointment.

### Were you vaccinated abroad?

At this time, unfortunately you cannot use CoronaCheck to create a vaccination certificate yet. In some countries, you can create a coronavirus pass while you are visiting that is also valid in the Netherlands. You can read more about it on {{ site.data.translations.coronabewijs-hulp-link[page.lang] }}.

## Test certificate
### Testing for access

Do you want to use a coronavirus pass for access to events and locations within the Netherlands? <a href="https://www.testenvoortoegang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" hreflang="nl">Please go to Testen voor Toegang</a>. On this website you’ll find all relevant information, and you also can make an appointment there. If you’re visiting an event or location that requires proof of a negative corona test, the organization will usually provide you with information, for example on the ticket, in a confirmation email, or on the website.  

Are you unable to create a test certificate and were you tested longer than 24 hours ago? Then you have to make a new test appointment at <a href="https://www.testenvoortoegang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" hreflang="nl">Testen voor Toegang</a>.

## Recovery certificate 

ou may use a positive test result to create a certificate of recovery with CoronaCheck. A number of conditions apply:

- The positive test has been carried out by the GGD;
- The certificate of recovery is valid from 11 days after the positive test result, but the certificate of recovery can be created earlier;
- The positive test result is no more than 180 days old.

Do you meet these requirements, but are you unable to retrieve your recovery details in CoronaCheck? Please contact the GGD ({{ site.data.translations.phone-ggd[page.lang] }}) to check your details.

<strong>Please note:</strong> are your details properly registered with the GGD, but are you still unable to retrieve your details?

We are aware of this issue. We’re working hard to find out where the cause is in order to resolve the issue. If you are going on a trip or want to visit an event within a few days, the advice is to schedule a free test appointment. 
Make a test appointment to be able to travel within Europe via: {{ site.data.translations.coronabewijs-hulp-link[page.lang] }}. To gain access to an event in the Netherlands, make a test appointment via {{ site.data.translations.testen-voor-toegang-link[page.lang] }}.


If you’ve had a PCR test, you’ll receive a domestic and an international QR code. Did you do an antigen test? Then you’ll only receive a QR code valid for access within the Netherlands.

This means it is not possible to create a certificate of recovery based on the results of an antibody test.

DId you test positive longer than 180 days ago and did you tell your vaccinator wherefore you only needed 1 vaccination? Then it is possible to create your vaccination certificate. Are you unable to retrieve your vaccination details, please contact your vaccinator to check your registration.


## Problems with DigiD? 

To retrieve your vaccination details in CoronaCheck, you need a valid DigiD. <a href="https://www.digid.nl/en/apply-or-activate-digid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">You can request it via this link</a>.  A request for a new DigiD takes a couple of working days to process.

You can log in with DigiD via the app (<a href="https://www.digid.nl/en/login-methods/digid-app" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download the DigiD app here</a>) or via the DigiD website, using SMS verification. <a href="https://www.digid.nl/en/login-methods/sms-verification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Read more about setting up SMS verification here</a>.
